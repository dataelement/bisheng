# Welcome to Bisheng

## What Is Bisheng?

Bisheng is a leading open-source platform for developing large-scale applications. It empowers and accelerates the development and deployment of large-scale applications, helping users enter the next generation of application development with the best experience.

The name "Bisheng" refers to the inventor of the movable-type printing, which played a significant role in the dissemination of human knowledge. We hope that "Bisheng" can similarly provide strong support for the widespread implementation of intelligent applications. We welcome everyone to join us.

Bisheng is released under the [Apache 2.0 License](https://github.com/dataelement/bisheng/blob/main/LICENSE) and was officially open-sourced at the end of August 2023.


## Product Highlights

- Convenience: Even business professionals can quickly build intelligent applications centered around large models using our pre-configured application templates through a simple and intuitive form-filling method.
- Flexibility: For those familiar with large model technology, we offer hundreds of development components in line with the latest developments in the large model technology ecosystem. With visual and flexible process orchestration capabilities, you can develop any type of large model application, not limited to simple prompt word projects.
- Reliability and Enterprise-Ready: Many similar open-source projects are only suitable for experimental and testing scenarios, lacking enterprise-level features for real production use. These include high availability under high concurrency, continuous application operation and performance optimization, practical features tailored to real business scenarios, all of which are differentiating capabilities of the Bisheng platform. Additionally, it's worth noting that data quality within enterprises can vary widely. To fully leverage all data, comprehensive unstructured data governance capabilities are essential. Our team has accumulated this core capability over the past few years, and in Bisheng's demo environment, you can seamlessly integrate these capabilities through relevant components, with unlimited and free usage.。
